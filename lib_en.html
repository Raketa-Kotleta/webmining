					The authors propose using blockchain-based smart contract technology to reduce transaction costs and improve the efficiency of interaction in regional innovation systems. The solution ensures safe and transparent interaction between participants, automates the conclusion of contracts, registration and transfer of intellectual property rights. The system is based on the Ethereum platform, which allows creating decentralized applications and implementing innovative projects without the need to involve intermediaries. This helps optimize interaction, reduce risks and develop regional innovation ecosystems.
