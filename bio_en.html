					About me
				</h2>
				<p class="arial" style="line-height: 1.5;">
					At the moment I am a student at Kuban State University, I am studying in the 2nd year of the Master's program in the field of "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science". I started doing front-end development a little over a year ago after some circumstances:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Successful completion of the web development curriculum;
Receiving an order for the development of an online store. Took courses on studying VueJS and its libraries Vue-Router, Vuex.
During my studies, I got acquainted with many PLs and have an idea of ​​such languages ​​as JavaScript, Java, Python (Django), PHP, C++, C#, Kotlin, Clojure, Prolog, Assembler, SQL (OracleDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL), Cypher (Neo4j), Solidity. I have a general understanding of OOP. In the 3rd year, I completed a summer internship at InitLab, during which I studied working with CMS Drupal.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				In addition to front-end development, I am also interested in the Blockchain topic. I have an idea of ​​the principles of this technology. I developed small decentralized web applications in the Solidity language based on the Ethereum network.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I spent some time doing Android development.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				As for my personal qualities, I can say that I am quite a sociable, responsive person. I like to go to IT-related events. I have participated in hackathons several times, where I defended the team in project presentations each time. I enjoy playing musical instruments, doing sports, and leading a healthy lifestyle.
