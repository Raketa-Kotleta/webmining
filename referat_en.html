					Introduction
				</h1>
				<p class="arial">
					Copyright management plays an important role in protecting intellectual property in the context of digitalization. Traditional approaches face problems such as difficulty in verifying authorship, infringement of rights, and lack of transparency in the use of content. Blockchain technology offers modern solutions to these problems, ensuring security, immutability of data, and automation of processes.

					Basic concepts
				</h1>
				<p class="arial">
					Blockchain is a distributed ledger where information is recorded in the form of immutable blocks linked in a chain. This technology provides decentralized data storage, which eliminates the need to trust third parties.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Smart contracts are programmable contracts that automatically execute the terms set by the parties. In the context of copyright management, they can be used for licensing, automatic royalty payments, and tracking the use of content.

					Blockchain in Copyright Management
				</h1>
				<p class="arial">
					Blockchain provides the ability to register rights to works, where information about the author and terms of use are recorded in a decentralized network. This allows for the automation of the licensing process, as smart contracts can independently process payments and transfer rights. Blockchain also helps track the use of works in the digital environment, which is essential for monitoring compliance with license terms. Unique digital fingerprints of works stored in the blockchain guarantee protection against plagiarism, simplifying proof of authorship.

					Advantages
				</h1>
				<p class="arial">
					The main advantages of using blockchain are transparency, as records are available for verification, and security, provided by cryptographic methods. Automation of processes allows to reduce costs and eliminate intermediaries. However, the technology faces a number of challenges: from the need for legal adaptation in different countries to issues of network scalability and the difficulty of its implementation for a wide audience.

					Conclusion and results
				</h1>
				<p class="arial">
					Blockchain opens up new possibilities for copyright management, making the processes of licensing and content protection more transparent and efficient. Despite the existing challenges, this technology has significant potential and can become the basis for the creation of a modern intellectual property ecosystem.
